Helper scripts for acceptance tests
-----------------------------------

The programs all have an 'accept' target which runs acceptance
tests, this directory contains some supporting scripts

  accept-*.sh : sourced by the accept.sh script, setup & teardown
  assert.sh   : likewise, used for test assetions [1]
  equal-*     : scripts which test if files are essentially the same
