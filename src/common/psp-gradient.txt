The PaintShop Pro gradient format
---------------------------------

PaintShop Pro gradients typically have the extension 
.jgd (in earlier version) or .PspGradient (in more recent 
versions). The format is binary and holds independent 
48-bit RGB and 8-bit opacity gradients, along with an
embedded gradient name.

The format
----------

Here all ushorts are 2-byte big-endian unsigned integers.

<psp gradient> =
  <header>
  <rgb block>
  <op block>
  <gradient end>

<header> = 
  uchar[4] = [8 B G R],  magic number
  ushort[2], unknown, major/minor version of format? (usually 3/1)
  uchar[1], the title length n
  char[n], title (without a terminating null)

<rgb block> = 
  ushort[1], number of rgb samples
  <rbg initial seg>
  <rgb seg>
     :
  <rgb seg>
  <block end>

<op block>
  ushort[1], number of opacity samples
  <op seg>
     :
  <op seg>
  <block end>

<rgb initial seg>
  ushort[8] = [0 0 0 m 0 r g b], midpoint & rgb values (z implicitly 0)

<rgb seg>
  ushort[10] = [0 0 0 m 0 z 0 r g b], midpoint, z & rgb values

<op seg>
  ushort[5] = [0 z 0 m p], midpoint & opacity 

<block end>
  ushort[2] = [0 0]

<gradient end> 
  ushort[1] = [0]
   
Remarks
-------

Here

  z is the z-coordinate 0 <= z <= 2^12 = 4096 
  m is the mid-point    0 <= m <= 100
  p is the opacity      0 <= p <= 256 
  rgb are the channels  0 <= r,g,b < 2^16 = 65536

Odd that the rgb gradient has a special initial segment
(which lacks [0 z], so z is taken to be zero), yet the
opacity gradient does not. 

The midpoint m[i] is the percentage of the displacement 
from z[i] to z[i+1], and PSP output always has this value
between 5 and 95. The midpoint of the final segment is
unused (PSP output has this midpoint 50).

The reason for the midpoint is to control a (presumably)
nonlinear curve through rgb/p space. The form of this
curve as used in PSP is not yet determined.

The above is a complete description, in particular the 
angle, repeat and type (linear, radial) are not part of
to the format.
