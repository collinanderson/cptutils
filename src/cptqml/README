This is almost done, but I couldn't find a way to actually
load a qml file into QGis so that I could inspect it, the dev
mailing list does not respond to queries and the DTD for the
qml format is hoplessly broken.

So I'll abandon this for now, perhaps one day a QGis user who
knows how to inspect the style file will contact me.

Update 13 March, tried a question on stackoverflow GIS
