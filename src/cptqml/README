This is almost done, but I couldn't find a way to actually
load a qml file into QGis so that I could inspect it, the dev
mailing list does not respond to queries and the DTD for the
qml format is hoplessly broken.

Update 13 March, tried a question on stackoverflow GIS

Still to do - at the moment we always create a continuous
'interpolated' scale, and we only use the left-hand of the
cpt segments (so the last colour is missing). Not quite sure
how QGIS does discrete scales, where is the break?
