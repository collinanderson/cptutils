1.02 :
  some reorganiation prior to coding up cptgimp:
  - split code between common & gimpcpt diretcories
  - added Common.mk
  - tidied up Makefiles a bit

1.01 :
  minor modification to handle the change to the
  gimp's gradient file format: an additional line
	
     Name: <name>

  has been added to the files, and they are given
  the .grd extension. 
  - we now check the second line of the file to see
    if it a name line, and if so save that to print
    in the output cpt file
  - we search for gradients (still with typeglobs) 
    with names <name> and <name>.grd
  - header in output cpt file tidied a little

1.00 :
  minor documentation changes 

0.94 :
  src/gradient.c now handles gradients which lie 
  about the number of segments they contain (but 
  issues a warning if the declared number differs 
  from th number found). All of the AG gradients
  can now be converted.

0.93 :
  animation target prettified
  target <gradient>.png (make a povray rendering) added
  Makefile tidied

0.92 :
  src/anim.ini added
  src/Makefile.in extra target *.gif added, makes
    a gif animation of the gradient in RGB space, mmm.

0.91 : 
  src/Makefile corrections
  INSTALL corrections
