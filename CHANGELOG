Changes $Id: CHANGELOG,v 1.7 2004/02/29 19:59:42 jjg Exp jjg $

1.8 : (unreleased)
  - corrected minor glitch in common/cpt.c, now whitespace   
    at the start of the line does not cause a scan failure.
  - cptinfo now reads the file size.

1.7 : (unreleased)
  - added cptinfo program for the "cpt city" website  

1.6 : (unreleased)
  - added cpt simplification to gimpcpt, with some extra
    code needed in common/cpt.c and  common/colour.c

1.5 : (unreleased)
  - gimpcpt repaired to work with the changes in colour.c
  - first version of the cptgimp manual page

1.4 : (unreleased)
  cptgimp implemented
  - extended colour.h to handle the hsv & rgb colour types in 
    cpt files
  - cptgimp is lossless since the ggr format can easily capture
    any cpt rgb/hsv linear spline, natively. 
  - got confused by the myriad colour types in colour.c, so 
    reorganised the naming convertions, and standardised the 
    interface.
  - all the GMT standard palettes now seem to be converted
    correctly, sent of a tarball to some hungry beta testers
  - this all breaks gimpcpt

1.3 :
  converted gimpcpt to use gengetopt, which lead
  to tidying up of the makefile/configure setup. 
  Redid the test targets in gimpcpt

1.02 :
  some reorganisation prior to coding up cptgimp:
  - split code between common & gimpcpt diretcories
  - added Common.mk
  - tidied up Makefiles a bit

1.01 :
  minor modification to handle the change to the
  gimp's gradient file format: an additional line
	
     Name: <name>

  has been added to the files, and they are given
  the .grd extension. 
  - we now check the second line of the file to see
    if it a name line, and if so save that to print
    in the output cpt file
  - we search for gradients (still with typeglobs) 
    with names <name> and <name>.grd
  - header in output cpt file tidied a little

1.00 :
  minor documentation changes 

0.94 :
  src/gradient.c now handles gradients which lie 
  about the number of segments they contain (but 
  issues a warning if the declared number differs 
  from th number found). All of the AG gradients
  can now be converted.

0.93 :
  animation target prettified
  target <gradient>.png (make a povray rendering) added
  Makefile tidied

0.92 :
  src/anim.ini added
  src/Makefile.in extra target *.gif added, makes
    a gif animation of the gradient in RGB space, mmm.

0.91 : 
  src/Makefile corrections
  INSTALL corrections     

0.90 : 
  initial public release
